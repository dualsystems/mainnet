# emoney-3 Mainnet

This directory contains the official [genesis.json](genesis.json) file for the emoney-3 mainnet.

Below you'll find the instructions for participating in the upgrade from emoney-2.

## Preparing for the upgrade from emoney-2

* Install em-ledger [v0.9.7](https://github.com/e-money/em-ledger/releases/tag/v0.9.7) binaries
* Restart emd with `--halt-time 1632142800` to stop the emoney-2 chain on 2021-09-20 at 13:00:00 UTC
* Install Cosmovisor in preparation for future emoney-3 upgrades
* Signal readiness in [PARTICIPANTS.md](PARTICIPANTS.md)

## Generating genesis.json for emoney-3

* Make sure you followed the preparation steps above
* Wait until the halt time has passed and the chain has stopped
* Run `emd export --home <emoney-home> --for-zero-height > emoney-2.export.json`
* Install em-ledger [v1.1.0](https://github.com/e-money/em-ledger/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
* Run `emd migrate v0.9 emoney-2.export.json --chain-id emoney-3 > genesis.json`
* Run `jq -S -c -M '' genesis.json | shasum -a 256`

## Optional: Update git reposority
* Finally commit new genesis using `git add -f emoney-2.export.json genesis.json && git commit -m "Add emoney-3 genesis"`

## Optional: Migrate keyring

Since emcli is deprecated the default location of the **file based keyring** has changed as well.

You'll need to export wraped key from your keyring: `emcli keys export "key-name" > file-key.wrap` 

and import with emd (v1.1.0) : `emd keys import "key-name" file-key.wrap`
